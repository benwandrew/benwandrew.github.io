i'm curious about the rudiments of mind and mental illness; i'm motivated by the prospect of enhancing behavioral health care, deepening therapeutic relationships, and improving lives; and i value reason, autonomy, curiosity, creativity, honesty, humility, compassion, and communion.

questions that pique my curiosity center around human self-involving cognition, including its structure, development, computational basis, visceral underpinnings, social influences, and psychopathological implications. i’m particularly interested in how bodies and other minds shape experience; in other words, the interface between bodily perception, social learning, and self-knowledge, evaluation, and control. i hope to formalize processes that underlie this interface, characterize ways that those processes contribute to internalizing problems, psychosomatic symptoms, and self-destructive thought and behaviors, and translate such insights into real-world tools that enhance behavioral health care and improve treatment outcomes.

i’m also generally interested in contemplative inquiry, new mathematical and computational formalisms of mind, and translational research tools.

currently, i'm an apprentice researcher and technologist affiliated with the carney center for computational brain science (ccbs) at brown university. as a member of the ccbs team, i'm honing my scientific and product development skills, contributing to basic and applied research agendas, and helping build an interdisciplinary program that bridges academia and industry. i earned degrees in mathematics and economics before gravitating toward the cognitive and clinical sciences, and i continue to think and probe across disciplines.

## research interests

- **perception:** bodily perception, time perception
- **learning:** social learning, structure learning
- **self-involving cognition:** theory-of-self, self-referential reasoning & decision-making
- **mental health:** internalizing disorders, psychosomatic illness, self-injury (direct and indirect)

## other interests

- **contemplative practice:** indo-tibetan meditation, dzogchen, body scanning
- **translational research tools**
- **the outdoors:** i love to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/benwandrew/" target="_blank">ride bikes and ski</a>, which i experience as communion with nature and friends, atop such elegant human ingenuity, powered by the marvel of metabolism, for the sake of fun and flourishing.
