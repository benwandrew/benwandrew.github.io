i am curious about the rudiments of mind and mental illness; i am motivated by the prospect of enhancing behavioral health care, deepening therapeutic relationships, and improving lives; and i value reason, autonomy, curiosity, creativity, resilience, honesty, humility, compassion, and communion.

currently, i am an apprentice researcher and technologist working with <a href="https://fpetzschner.com/" target="_blank">frederike petzschner</a> at the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/carney/ccbs" target="_blank">carney center for computational brain science (ccbs)</a>. as a member of the ccbs team, i am honing my scientific and technological skills, contributing to basic and applied research agendas, and helping build an interdisciplinary program that bridges academia and industry. i studied mathematics, economics, and physics before gravitating toward the cognitive and clinical sciences, and i continue to think and probe across disciplines.

i love to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/benwandrew/" target="_blank">ride bikes and ski</a>, which i experience as communion with nature and friends, atop such elegant human ingenuity, powered by the marvel of metabolism, for the sake of fun and flourishing.
