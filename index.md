i am curious about the rudiments of mind and mental illness; i am motivated by the prospect of enhancing behavioral health care, deepening therapeutic relationships, and improving lives; and i value reason, autonomy, curiosity, creativity, honesty, humility, compassion, and communion.

generally, i am interested in building computational and statistical tools that enhance clinical insight and acumen; that is, tools which improve clinicians' abilities to detect, understand, predict, and treat mental illness. i hope to augment and streamline such abilities so that providers can focus on what they do best and what matters most - connecting with and caring for individuals experiencing mental distress.

currently, i am an apprentice researcher working with <a href="https://fpetzschner.com/" target="_blank">frederike petzschner</a> at the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/carney/ccbs" target="_blank">carney center for computational brain science (ccbs)</a>. as a member of the ccbs team, i am honing my scientific and technical skills, contributing to basic and applied research agendas, and helping build an interdisciplinary program that bridges academia and industry. i studied mathematics, economics, and physics before gravitating toward the cognitive and clinical sciences, and i continue to think and probe across disciplines.

### current research interests
- aversive learning in the context of chronic pain and other (psycho)somatic symptoms
- dynamic relationships between mood and somatic symptoms
- psychometrics (esp multivariate longitudinal measurement of individual differences)
- methods: adaptive methods (esp via active learning), real-time sampling, within-person prediction and intervention

### other interests
- translational research tools 
- contemplative practice: indo-tibetan meditation, body scanning
- the arts: poetry, harmonica
- the outdoors: i love to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/benwandrew/" target="_blank">ride bikes and ski</a>, which i experience as communion with nature and friends, atop such elegant human ingenuity, powered by the marvel of metabolism, for the sake of fun and flourishing
