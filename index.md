i am curious about the rudiments of mind and mental illness; i am motivated by the prospect of enhancing behavioral health care, deepening therapeutic relationships, and improving lives; and i value reason, autonomy, curiosity, creativity, resilience, honesty, humility, compassion, and communion.

questions that pique my curiosity center around human self-involving cognition, including its structure, development, computational basis, visceral underpinnings, social influences, and psychopathological implications. i am particularly interested in how our bodies and our interactions with other people shape how we think about ourselves and behave accordingly; in other words, the interface between bodily perception, social reasoning, and self-knowledge, self-evaluation, and self-control. i hope to formalize processes that underlie this interface, characterize ways that those processes contribute to internalizing problems, psychosomatic symptoms, and self-destructive thought and behaviors, and translate such insights into real-world tools that enhance behavioral health care and improve treatment outcomes. more generally, i am interested in measuring and modeling how cognitive and psychological variation across people relates to real-life (clinical) outcomes.

currently, i am an apprentice researcher working with <a href="https://fpetzschner.com/" target="_blank">frederike petzschner</a> at the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/carney/ccbs" target="_blank">carney center for computational brain science (ccbs)</a>. as a member of the ccbs team, i am honing my scientific and technical skills, contributing to basic and applied research agendas, and helping build an interdisciplinary program that bridges academia and industry. i studied mathematics, economics, and physics before gravitating toward the cognitive and clinical sciences, and i continue to think and probe across disciplines.

### research interests
- perception: bodily (e.g., interoception), temporal
- reasoning & decision-making: social (theory of mind), self-referential (theory of self)
- mental health: internalizing tendencies, psychosomatic symptoms, transdiagnostic dimensions of self-destructive behaviors (e.g., disordered eating, nssi)
- methods: experimental design optimization (e.g, ADO), multivariate longitudinal measurement, real-time sampling, digital phenotyping

### other interests
- translational research tools, biostatistics in mental health, psychiatric epidemiology
- contemplative practice: indo-tibetan meditation, body scanning
- the arts: poetry, harmonica
- the outdoors: i love to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/benwandrew/" target="_blank">ride bikes and ski</a>, which i experience as communion with nature and friends, atop such elegant human ingenuity, powered by the marvel of metabolism, for the sake of fun and flourishing
